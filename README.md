## Motivation

As an IT student in the field of Cybersecurity and Server Administration, this website helps me provide a coup d'Å“il for individuals from other fields into the realm of extensive terminal usage where GUIs are underrated. 


## Start guide

1.  Open terminal in the downloaded folder.
2.  Type the following npm command

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
3. That's it! (Yes, it's that minimal)

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.
